\section{Procedure}%
\label{sec:procedure}

We outline 360 hours of work below.

\subsection{Identify congestion control primitives} 
We will identify a set of sufficiently general primitives datapaths should expose by studying the designs and respective implementations of existing congestion control algorithms. 110 hours.

\subsection{Design a sufficiently expressive API for congestion control algorithms}
Using the set of primitives as a base, we will design an API expressive enough to implement various congestion control algorithms, and enable new ones. The design of this API is undetermined; a key question is how algorithm implementations will query the datapath for congestion control information. 110 hours.

\subsection{Evaluate the extent to which occasional modulation of congestion control decisions causes modified behavior}
We will design and implement a research prototype with which we will write implementations of existing congestion control algorithms. We will use this prototype to determine whether occasional control is sufficient for congestion control. 110 hours.

\subsection{Report Preparation}
30 hours.

\section{Facilities}
\label{sec:facilities}

We will require general-purpose computing resources as well as high-speed (\eg $10$ Gbit/s) networking equipment.
